Aspect ratio is a term used to describe the proportional relationship between the width and height of an image, screen, or display. It is commonly expressed as a ratio of width to height. Aspect ratio is essential because it determines how an image or display appears visually, affecting its overall shape and proportions.

Aspect ratio is typically represented as two numbers separated by a colon (e.g., 16:9), where the first number represents the width and the second number represents the height.

 For example:

An aspect ratio of 4:3 means that for every 4 units of width, there are 3 units of height.
An aspect ratio of 16:9 means that for every 16 units of width, there are 9 units of height.

To calculate aspect ratio, you can use the following formula:

Aspect Ratio= Height/Width

For example, if you have an image that is 1920 pixels wide and 1080 pixels high (commonly known as Full HD resolution), you can calculate the aspect ratio as follows:

Aspect Ratio= 1080/1920   =1.7778

Aspect ratio is crucial for ensuring that images and graphics display correctly on various devices and screens without distortion or stretching
